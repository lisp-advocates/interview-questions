## Introduction

[SynaptiQ](https://www.3e.eu/synaptiq/) is a tool to monitor and
report the performance of a diversity of solar and wind assets. We
heard (via a job announce) that SynaptiQ's data engine is built in
Common Lisp, and the web API and interface in Clojure.

- Can you present us a bit more what SynaptiQ does?

- So what does SynaptiQ use Common Lisp for?

- What other technologies do you use ?

- How did you begin with Common Lisp, and how is it you are so well
  versed in Lisps (cf Clojure)?

- So why do you use Common Lisp? What are its key advantages for your domain?

  - Do you happen to rely on Common Lisp's interactive capabilities when the software is deployed?

- The trend of new languages today is about strong static type
  inference. What importance do you give it for your domain? Do you
  use a lot of Lisp's type declarations?

- Does 3E use Common Lisp in other projects?

- Does 3E have a process to choose technologies?


## Ecosystem

- What Common Lisp implementation(s) are you running and why?

- Do you use Open Source libraries?

- Are you involved in Open Source, or plan to? (open-sourcing or
  contributing to libraries, speaking to events, supporting projects
  financially, blogging…)

- Did you encounter Open Source libraries you had limited success with? What would need to be changed?


## Deployment

- What constraints are you facing when deploying new SynaptiQ versions?

- What is your deployment process like?

- What were the key difficulties you had with deployment, not necessarily Common Lisp related?


## Workflow

- How big is your codebase and how do you organize your development process?


## Difficulties

- What were the key difficulties you had to overcome in your project?

- What were the key difficulties related to Common Lisp?

- What do you miss from other languages in Common Lisp?

- Which areas of the ecosystem in general you believe could use more collective love from the Lisp community?


## Developers

### Staff

- How many Common Lisp programmers does your company employ? (and has there been more before?)

- What OS and tools (editors,…) do your developers use?


### Recruiting

- How would you describe your experience with Common Lisp recruiting?

- What is your onboarding process for the new developers? There is a known
  criticism that a lisp codebase evolves into it's own DSL, which can make it
  harder for the new developers to understand the code. Do you have experience
  on that?


### Remote Work

- Does you company support remote positions for Common Lisp programmers?

- What were the key difficulties you've encountered with remote Common Lisp positions / What has prevented you from offering remote positions?


### Networking

- Do you work with any other Common Lisp companies?

- Do you participate on /r/lisp on Reddit or on other places?


## Future

- What does the short future for SynaptiQ look like?

- What is your vision for Common Lisp in your company?

- What is your vision for the Common Lisp and Common Lisp ecosystem in general? What are the steps that you are taking to get there?
