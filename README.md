# Welcome to Lisp Interviews!

Lisp Interviews is an effort by [Lisp
Advocates](https://www.reddit.com/r/lispadvocates) to highlight the companies
running Common Lisp in production, as well as notable Lisp individuals, for the
greater good of the ecosystem and each and every one of us!

We take pride in giving voice to the Lisp community, and so this repository is
holding our community's best knowledge on how to interview the Lisp companies
and individuals. You can make your own voice heard by interacting with the
issue tracker, as well as joining [our community on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lispadvocates)!

You can find the template for all companies under [companies/template.md](companies/template.md). We'll prepare the more specialized versions for the
specific companies in the same folder.

Let us know which companies you are most interested in being highlighted first!

You can find (and contribute to!) the lists of Lisp companies here:
