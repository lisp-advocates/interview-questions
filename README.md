# Welcome to Lisp Interviews!

Lisp Interviews is an effort by [Lisp
Advocates](https://www.reddit.com/r/lispadvocates) to highlight the companies
running Common Lisp in production, for the greater good of the ecosystem and
the all of us!

We take pride in giving voice to the Lisp community, and so this repository is
holding our community's best knowledge on how to interview Lisp companies, as
well as notable Lisp individuals. You can make your own voice heard by
interacting with the issue tracker, as well as joining our community on Reddit!

You can find the general template in `template.md`, as well as more specialized
questions for the specific companies under `companies/`.

Let us know which companies you are most interested to be approached first!

You can find (and contribute to!) the lists of Lisp companies here:
